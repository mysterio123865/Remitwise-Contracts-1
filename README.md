# RemitFlow Contract

RemitFlow is a cross-border remittance escrow smart contract for the
[Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org) platform on Stellar.

A sender locks token funds in escrow for a recipient with an expiry deadline.
The recipient can claim the funds before expiry; if they do not, the sender can
cancel the transfer and reclaim the funds after the deadline passes.
